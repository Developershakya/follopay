        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Let me start with the most important question people ask: "How much can I actually make?"
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Based on my experience and conversations with other active users, here's what you can realistically expect:
        </p>

        <div class="bg-blue-50 border-l-4 border-blue-500 p-6 mb-6">
            <h3 class="font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4">Monthly Earnings by Effort Level:</h3>
            <ul class="space-y-3 text-gray-700">
                <li><strong>Casual Users (2-3 hours/week):</strong> ₹800 - ₹1,500/month</li>
                <li><strong>Regular Users (1-2 hours/day):</strong> ₹3,500 - ₹5,500/month</li>
                <li><strong>Dedicated Users (2-3 hours/day):</strong> ₹7,000 - ₹12,000/month</li>
                <li><strong>Very Active Users (4+ hours/day):</strong> ₹15,000 - ₹25,000+/month</li>

        </div>

        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Important caveat: These numbers assume you're writing quality reviews that get approved. If your reviews keep getting rejected, your earnings will be much lower.

        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            When I started three months ago, I made a lot of mistakes. I didn't understand what made a good review, and I submitted poorly written content. Here's my actual progression:

            Not all reviews pay the same amount. Several factors determine how much you earn per review:

                <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-2">📱 Review Type & Platform</h3>
                <p class="text-gray-700">
                    Google Play Store reviews typically pay ₹50-150, while iOS app reviews pay more at ₹75-250. Service and product reviews vary widely depending on complexity.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="bg-white border border-gray-200 rounded-lg p-6">

                <p class="text-gray-700">
                    A quick 100-word review might earn ₹50, but a comprehensive 400-word review with specific examples can earn ₹150-200. FolloPay rewards detailed, helpful content.

                <p class="text-gray-700">
                    Users with consistently high-quality reviews (90%+ approval rate) sometimes get bonus payments or access to premium review tasks with higher pay.

                <p class="text-gray-700">
                    Reviews for popular apps sometimes pay slightly more because they reach larger audiences. But niche apps have fewer reviews, so task availability is lower.

                Yes, you can realistically earn ₹3,000-5,000+ per month on FolloPay if you're consistent and focus on quality. Some users earn significantly more. But this isn't passive income - it requires actual work and learning what makes a good review.
